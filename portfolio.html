    <p>This here you will find the starter product before my partner and I were able to make changes to it. This was originally a regular maze game.</p>
    <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/10128431/"> <img src="images/Finishedproduct.JPG" height="250" >
    <p>This here is the edited product, it has now changed to have an objective, and changed the idea of the game which is play or control Isaiah and reach Anthony to go to the party.</p>

    <p>Here is Tower Fall, originally my partner and I had an idea for a block that would fall according to how you drop it, as you delete the block under the box by tapping it, which may make the box tilt and fall to the side.</p>
